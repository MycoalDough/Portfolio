        <p id="big-text">Information</p>
        <p>In this game, the AI controls the stickfigure. He can: plant, water, reap, and buy (seeds or upgrades).<br>
        </p>
        <p>The PPO model has to learn how to manage its time correctly, because each action takes a lot of time. Moving takes the most, so it needs to savor what it does.</p>
        <br>
        <p><br><br>Overall, this project taught me the importance of binary flags and giving the AI more info so it doesn't need to waste training w+b on formulas I can give it.</p>

        <p>oh man did this project take longer than i thought it would...</p>

        <p>alright so basically i made this project within 3-4 days cause i was leaving the next week, so i wanted to train it (remote desktop allowed me to monitor and check)</p>
        <p>it never trained correctly over that week so i stopped it within the first day (it converged poorly). when i got back it took another week of tweaking a lot of stuff</p>
        <p>and then it finally worked! the main takeaway i got was: bianry flags, more inputs, more exploration lol; fun project nonetheless</p>
