        <p id="big-text">Information</p>
        <p>Using Unity, I created a custom made FNAF 1 environment that I can extract information from.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Then, using [socket], I connect this environment to my RL agent in python.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This connection allows me to send data between the env and the agent, such as env state and playing actions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The AI model is a D3QN with prioritized replay experience.</p>

        <p id="big-text">Michael's Description</p>
        <p>This was the first reinforcement project I did. After learning all the math and stuff, I watched an intro to RL with a snake game. I was like, "damn, I wonder if I can make it play FNAF"<br></p>
        <p>And then I did. It sucked a lot because I had no idea what I was doing (the input layer was wrong for 2 weeks). After actually reading papers and how to implement one, I was able to fix it</p>
        <p>and make it a D3QN model instead. It tends to waste power very often, and can only survive a max animatronic level of 7 (all of them at level 7)</p>
