        <p id="big-text">UPDATE</p>
        <p>This is V2 of this project. To see the original, click the link above.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Sooo, what's new? oh man we got a lot. Upgraded visuals with better models, better skybox, better shadows, better glow. Missiles and bullets glow and it looks insane!</p>
        <p>All enemies and teammates are given the ability to use EMPs and RAILGUNs, but VIPER still uses them more. new animations, new abilities!</p>
        <p>once you destroy most of the squadron, a 2nd boss will spawn in: NF-2401, a NAVAL DESTROYER. it is equipped with tons of support and attacks, but VIPER is still the main boss.</p>
        <p>also, at the end of the game, you are ranked on your gameplay. the highest rank is S, and lowest is F. you are graded on: time, damage dealt, and damage taken.</p>


        <br>
        <p><br><br>... and a ton more. just play the game. trust. i swear it's really good. please, this is a crazy game.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p id="big-text">Information</p>
        <p>In Unity, for my Game Design III semester final, I updated my aerial combat simulator in which you and your team face against the Viper Squadron.<br>
        </p>
        <p>The player can strafe left and right, spin around, use a gatling gun, missiles, and deploy flares. The AI ships (team and enemy) can use missiles, gatling guns, EMPs, and RAILGUNs.</p>
        <br>
        <p id="semi-red-text">Viper, the main enemy, can use EMPS, rocket storms, and a railgun, and has significantly higher HP.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To counteract this, your team (including yourself) are given shields that regenerate when you take no damage for a certain amount of time.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Aiming for the player requires you to aim ahead of where the enemy plane is; you need to predict their flight path.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You are able to choose your arsenal with 81 different combinations of attacks and setups!</p>
        <br>

        <p>BEST ROBLOX GAMES HANDS DOWN</p>
        <p>this project is relevant because Nurox (original creator of dts:np) updated his, and i did too</p>
        <p>to get this fight in the game, it requires you and your team to get to stage 34 and that happens a good 0% of the time in public lobbies sooooo</p>
