        <br><br>
        <p id="big-text">Information</p>
        <p>Using my LLM model MirageV6, I was able to summarize a PDF in 50 words or less.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This then allowed me to put it through another model that would convert this boring text into the personality of Yap Dollar.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Combinging it with images that relate to the summary and random sound effects, the script would then combine it all into an mp4.</p>

        <p id="big-text">Michael's Description</p>
        <p>i saw this project on instagram and thought it was hilarious but it costed money, so why not create it myself lol</p>
        <p style="color: orange;">TUTORIAL TIME!!!</p>
        <p>first, using fitz, i would open the pdf file to extract all the data. b/c of how small my model's token limit is, it can only take in pdfs of around 1/2 a page</p>
        <p>then, i would use the MirageV6 model to convert it to a consise summary. then, i'd put it through another model to make it have yap dollar's personality: going on random tangents, swearing, etc.</p>
        <p>b/c my model is so small, i also created a json with a list to store funny phrases that would randomly add itself to the script. using a final mirage model, i grabbed 15 nouns from the yap dollar script</p>
        <p>using the duckduckgo api, i then grabbed those images. sometimes the image it grabbed was in the wrong format, which is why i grabbed 15 and not 10 (i made there be 5 extra in case).</p>
        <p>to compile it all together, moviepy would grab the audio (random sentences would convert to spanish or chinese via deep_translator) and add it with bg music and the images that would change at an interval</p>
        <p>and finally, random selected sound effects would play at random times like in the actual yap dollar videos. finally, i play: XIAO HONG SHU!!!</p>
