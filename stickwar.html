        <p id="big-text">Information</p>
        <p>Using the game engine/editor Unity, I created the environment for the agents to train in. It is almost idential to Stick War 2 (with the exepction of a removal of some of the upgrades for games and AI to go/train faster.)<br>
        </p>

        <br>
        <p>To connect my environment to the 2 RL agents, I used [socket] to create threads the env and AI can request and send data through. This is how I gave the agents inputs and played their moves.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Two RL Agents were introduced to the environment, one played on the [ORDER] team and the other [CHAOS]. </p>
        <p id="semi-red-text"><br><br>The model I'm using is a Dueling Double Q Network, with Prioritized Experience Replay, N-Step Returns, and Noisy Layers. This model was applied to both agents.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Because the environment is very complex, it is going to take a decent amount of time to train, and I'm going for ~30k iterations. Currently, both models have trained for 2k. (5/18/24)</p>
