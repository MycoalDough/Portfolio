        <p>PPO models control stickfigures with different weapons, stats, etc. to fight in a simulation similar to YOMIH.<br>
        </p>
        <p>1v1, 2v2, 4v1 systems created for the models to train off of. 5 different unit types added so far.</p>
        <br>
        <p><br><br>A LOT of reward shaping was used for this project. Like, a lot. Like, more than I usually do. And that's typically a decent amount.</p>

        <p id="big-text">Michael's Description</p>
        <p>I LOVE STICKFIGURES.</p>

        <p>this project was based on the video game "Your Only Move is Hustle" (YOMIH) which is a strategic game where you control what your stickfigure does every frame</p>
        <p>that game was very slow b/c the amount of percision you need to put into your actions, but after doing so the battle would animate itself to become epic! </p>
        <p>however, each game took like ehh 20 mins? however, i decided to make 2 ai agents play this. reason? they think instantly, so the battle would play real time</p>
        <p>i added 5 different unit types! swordswrath = fast melee, archidon = poke, magikill = zoner + stunlock, spearton = tank</p>
        <p>admiral boss combined aspects of all 4! im planning on adding in more bosses and more unit types. (and yes this is based on stick war units) </p>
        <p>eventually, i want to make this multiplayer where people train their own ai, fight others online, get currency, and upgrade their training and weapons (somehow)</p>
